                <br>
                <p>Virtual accounts, also known as virtual accounts or <br>
                    virtual IBANs, are digital representation of traditional <br>
                    bank accounts that allow individuals and businesses <br>
                    to receive and make payments electronically.

        <div class="introduction">
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>The banking industry has undergone massive technological transformations in the past few decades, <br>
                and one of the most significant advancements is the introduction of virtual accounts. Virtual <br>
                accounts are digital representations of traditional bank accounts that exit only in the digital world. <br>
                in this case study. I examine the benefits and limitations of virtual accounts, how businesses use <br>
                them, and also the design approach created by me for Bani Africa's client base.

            </p>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>Bani Africa is a Fintech company that provide payment services such as virtual accounts, payment <br>
                link and more. They are building alternative payment infrastructure for the Global Economy. Which <br>
                means they are building infrastructure that is super easy for any business to easily and seamlessly <br>
                collect alternative payments from their customers.
            </p>
    </div>

            <h4>Process</h4>
            <br><br>
            <p>My design process required three phases:
                <ol>
                    <li>Brainstorming together with the other designer and the stakeholders</li><br>
                    <li>Prototyping different solutions</li> <br>
                    <li>Designing the UI screens with the interaction</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <br><br>
            <p>The few mockups below show the empty state of a merchant dashboard for virtual account, the <br>
                dashboard when active, and the merchant branch activity page.
            <br>

            <p>Due to non-disclosure agreements with Bani Africa, I have limitation to what I can share from the <br>
                designs, as they contain sensitive information and architecture. <br>

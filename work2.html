        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        
        <p>
          Payment link refers to a unique URL or web address that directs
          customers to a secure online<br />
          payment page. This payment link can be used to receive payments from
          customers who are unable<br />
          to pay directly through a company's website. This type of payment
          system is particularly useful for<br />
          businesses that sell products or services online but don't have a
          secure payment gateway integrated<br />
          into their website.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Background</h4>
        
        <p>
          Bani Africa is a Fintech company that provide payment services such as
          virtual accounts, payment <br />
          link and more. They are building alternative payment infrastructure
          for the Global Economy. Which <br />
          means they are building infrastructure that is super easy for any
          business to easily and seamlessly <br />
          collect alternative payments from their customers.
        </p>
    </div>
        <br />
        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>
          My design process process involved several stages, including
          prototyping, testing, and iteration. In the initial <br />
          stage, I created a low-fidelity wireframe of the payment link that
          would be integrated into the <br />
          website. The wireframe included the main features of the payment link,
          such as the payment form, <br />
          the payment options, and the confirmation page.
          <br />
          I then created a high-fidelity prototype that was tested by several
          users. The prototype was designed <br />
          to be user-friendly and intuitive, with clear instructions and
          easy-to-understand icons. <br />
          The next step was to conduct user testing sessions to see how users
          interacted with the payment <br />
          link. During the testing sessions, we observed how users navigated
          through the payment form and <br />
          the confirmation page, and how they responded to various prompts and
          notifications. Based on the <br />
          feedback received, I made several changes to the design, including
          adjusting the placement of <br />
          certain elements and adding additional information to help users
          understand the payment process. <br />
          Finally, I conducted a thorough quality assurance (QA) testing to
          ensure that the payment link was <br />
          functioning correctly and that there were no bugs or errors. The QA
          testing was performed by a <br />
          dedicated team of testers who conducted extensive testing on various
          devices and browsers.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Outcome</h4>
        <p>
          The fianl product was a secure and user-friendly payment link that
          made it easy for customers to <br />
          make payments for their purchases

        <p>
          Due to non-disclosure agreements with Bani Africa, I have limitation
          to what I can share from the <br />
          designs, as they contain sensitive information and architecture.
          <br />
        </p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          The payment link project was a success because we approached the
          design process with a <br />
          customer-focused mindset. By conducting thorough research and user
          testing, we were able to <br />
          create a payment link that was both secure and easy to use. The
          payment link helped streamline the <br />
          checkout process and provided customers with a seamless and secure
          experience.

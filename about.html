        <h2>A little bit about myself...</h2>

        <div class="text">
        <p class="p">
            My name is Adebayode, passionate about work that improves <br>
            accessibility for human race. I enjoy learning new things <br>
            everyday and love meeting people who are motivated about <br>
            sharing ideas with the world. I currently live in Lagos State, <br>
            Nigeria, ready and open to work globally.
            <br>
            Growing up, I found love for art-related activities, like drawing on <br>
            sketchbook. After going through life struggles for years, I <br>
            became aware and fascinated with the way we humans act, <br>
            think, and feel. Also, how products could help us live more <br>
            fulfilling lives.
            <br>
            <br>
            I started my design career as a graphics/brand designer, <br>
            creating unique identities for businesses, startups, and <br>
            individuals. Over the years, I have grown to understand the <br>
            importance and the purpose of creating digital products for <br>
            human race to the point of planning to own one.
            <br>
            <br>
            My recent role was at Bani - a financial tech startups that <br>
            provides solutions for alternative payment infrastructure for the <br>
            Global Economy . I was part of the design team. I created the <br>
            payment link(responive web designs for both the merchants <br>
            and the clients) - one of their products. I also work on the virtual <br>
            account design with the other designer.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm currently open to new role as a senior or mid level product <br>
            designer and I'm open to full-time, hybrid, contract, or <br>
            completely remote.
            <br>
            <br>
            I enjoy teaching design to interested people and also mentor <br>
            them on their design journey, preparing them for the task ahead <br>
            until they land their first role.
            <br>
            <br>
            If I'm not designing, I'm a workout enthusiasts, and enjoy <br>
            exploring new places. I also hosting casual and professional <br>
            events.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm always down to collaborate. Reach out and let's chat!
